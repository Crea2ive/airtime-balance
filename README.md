CALCULATING CREDIT BALANCE USING CALL LOG FILE FROM GSM GATEWAY

This code is designed to analyze an extracted call log file in .csv format obtained from a GSM gateway device with four ports. 
Each port on the GSM gateway corresponds to a SIM card. The code will prompt you to input the port name and the total amount you 
have recharged on the corresponding SIM card. This information is then used to calculate the credit balance associated with each SIM card.
